# CommiAI-ED
 is a cutting-edge web app enhancing communication skills with real-time feedback and analysis. Using AI, deep learning, and NLP, it provides actionable improvements for both speech and posture. Perfect for professionals, students, and anyone seeking to boost their speaking and presentation abilities.


## Problem Statement
In real-time communication, individuals often struggle with conveying their thoughts confidently and effectively, hindered by limited vocabulary, poor sentence framing, inadequate posture, and grammar issues. The absence of real-time feedback mechanisms exacerbates these challenges. Our sophisticated system utilizes real-time speech analysis, posture detection, facial recognition, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to enhance communication skills. By integrating these technologies, the system offers instant feedback on posture, facial expressions, vocabulary usage, sentence structure, and grammar. The goal is to empower users to communicate more confidently and proficiently in various contexts, including presentations, meetings, and public speaking engagements, while facilitating continuous learning and improvement.
## Solution

An avant-garde web application meticulously engineered to revolutionize communication skills through real-time, multidimensional feedback mechanisms Integrates a symphony of advanced AI, deep learning neural networks, and sophisticated React libraries, fortified by cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to deliver granular insights and hyper-precise optimizations for both verbal and non-verbal communication Architected to catapult user confidence and communicative prowess to unprecedented heights, this solution leverages real-time analysis and adaptive learning methodologies, ensuring unparalleled proficiency in diverse and demanding communication scenarios


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
